# Swift Package Manager Static Dynamic Xcode Bug

Since Xcode 11.4 and Swift 5.2 you may experience some trouble regarding SPM and compilation errors due to

* Library duplication

Create **SPMLibraries** is a possible workaround to continue using SPM with Xcode 11.4 and avoid moving all your external dependencies to `.dynamic` ones.

## Step by Step

* commit 1: *08e32fb3d4083b4bbaf49d25b72175a9a4a575a8*: project without libraries (‚úÖ compile)
  * this commit contains placeholder for the main screen and the widget
* commit 2: *35c46375496b850e751c48385d6ed41ac0486d46* add just the first external library (SwiftClockUI) with SPM for the main project (‚úÖ compile)
  * I don't try to use the external library for the Widget
* commit 3: *hash* add the same external library for the Widget (‚ùå won't compile)
  * Library duplication: Swift package product 'your library' is linked as a static library by 'your project' and 'your widget'. This will result in duplication of library code. üòû
